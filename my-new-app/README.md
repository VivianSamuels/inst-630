# Welcome to my beautiful mess!

This is intended to be a final project for INST630.

It has a lot of room for improvement before it is ready for the final submission.

Let's go over our progress so far.

## The Glows
Despite being relatively blank, bare bones of a webpage are obvious, which I will consider a win.

There is a clear logo, nav bar, and background for main content.

There is a graph. It isn't flashy (yet), however the graph is proof that I was able to successfully isolate data, load a charting library, and create a data visualization.

This one is not really a project glow, but I am confident in finding and testing charting libraries. Not really relevant to the assignment but it's a huge academic win thanks to this class.

## The Grows
The bare bones are missing some ribs. It is uncleare exactly where the data visualizations will go once they are fully loaded onto the webpage.

The graph is missing some key elements. Data should be accessible, and that includes having things like a title, clear labels, and an easy to understand legend. This elements are still a work in progress.

There is only one graph. Despite being able to successful isolate data for two visualizations, I am unable to get them to appear at the same time without completely breaking my webpage. I do not know why. I intend to become a nuisance on Discord after a good night's sleep.

It's ugly. As a future designer (or PM, who knows?), I need to be intentional with my design. The same amount of effort put in the data should be put into the design work.

## End Goal
I want to have 4 different data visualizations;\
A bar graph representing the number of words spoken by the characters\
A bubble chart for the number of times the word "force" is said\
A word cloud for the words spoken the most frequently\
A pie chart representing the amount of dialogue spoken on each planet
